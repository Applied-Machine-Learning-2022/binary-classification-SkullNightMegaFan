    "Some of these terms might be new, so let's explore them a bit more.\n",
    " \n",
    "[Classification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistical_classification) is the process of mapping a set of data points to a finite set of labels. From our [regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_analysis) labs, you likely remember that regression models such as [linear regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression) map input variables to a range of continuous values. In the domain of machine learning, models that predict continuous values are considered regression models. Models that predict a known finite set of values are considered classification models.\n",
    " \n",
    "*So what does binary mean?*\n",
    " \n",
    "Binary means there are only two values to predict. Binary classification is used to predict one of two values. These can be *true*/*false*, *malignant*/*benign*, *yes*/*no*, or any possible this-or-that options. For simplicity, these options are usually encoded as 1 and 0.\n",
    " \n",
    "*And what about logistic regression?*\n",
    " \n",
    "You've already seen linear regression, which attempts to fit a line to a set of data in order to predict continuous values. [Logistic regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression) similarly attempts to fit a line to data. However, the line is typically a [logistic/sigmoid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) curve. Instead of predicting a continuous value, the model uses the logistic curve to split the data into two classes. One class falls to one side of the line, and the other class falls to the other side of the line."
